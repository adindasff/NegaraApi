This group assignment was for the 4th semester course on Laboratory of Problem Solving with C. The problems that need to be solved are the determination of an effective border path for a fire nation based on the headquarters located on the Earth's surface. The path should encompass as many headquarters as possible and have a distance between headquarters that does not exceed 2500 km. This problem can be solved using the Convex Hull Algorithm, which utilizes the Jarvis March algorithm and the Haversine equation for distance calculations. The program created has several problem decompositions, such as validation mechanisms and file opening, determining the effective border path, calculating the total distance of the effective border, and determining the headquarters located outside the effective border path.
